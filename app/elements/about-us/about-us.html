      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p id='aboutParagraph'>Sunee Haws Eardley and Judi Haws Coburn are sisters who grew up dreaming of their chance to attend Brigham Young University. For both, this dream came true! Sunee graduated in 1997 with her B.A. in Mathematics and later received her Master’s degree from Southern Utah University. She is the mother of five children and lives in St. George, Utah. Judi graduated from BYU in 2007 with her B.S. in Exercise Science. She is the mother of four boys and lives in Hooper, Utah. Both sisters met their husbands on BYU’s campus and are passing on the tradition of being “true blue” to their children. Feel free to reach out to Sunee and Judi at: eardley.coburn@gmail.com. They’d love to hear from you!.</p>
